## Pitch

A real-time posture analysis proof-of-concept that leverages MediaPipe's computer vision capabilities to detect and analyze posture through web-based video streaming. This POC demonstrates the feasibility of using AI-powered pose detection to provide immediate feedback on posture quality.

## Users

- Developers exploring MediaPipe integration for health and wellness applications
- Researchers investigating real-time posture detection capabilities
- Product teams evaluating computer vision solutions for ergonomic monitoring
- Health tech professionals interested in preventive posture correction tools

## The Problem

Poor posture is increasingly common in our digital-first world, leading to long-term health issues. Current posture monitoring solutions are either:
- Hardware-dependent and expensive
- Not real-time or immediate
- Require specialized equipment or wearables
- Lack accessibility through standard web browsers

## Differentiators

- **Web-native**: Runs entirely in the browser without additional software installation
- **Real-time analysis**: Immediate pose detection and feedback using MediaPipe
- **Computer vision powered**: Leverages advanced pose and face landmarker models
- **Proof-of-concept focused**: Demonstrates technical feasibility for future development
- **Accessible**: Uses standard webcam input available on most devices

## Key Features

- Real-time pose detection using MediaPipe Pose Landmarker
- Face orientation analysis with MediaPipe Face Landmarker
- Web-based video streaming integration
- Posture quality assessment (good/bad classification)
- Browser-compatible implementation
- Technical feasibility validation for posture monitoring applications
