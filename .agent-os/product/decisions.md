## 2025-08-03: Initial POC Technical Approach

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical Architecture
**Stakeholders:** Developer, Product Owner

### Decision

Use MediaPipe's Pose Landmarker and Face Landmarker for real-time posture detection in a web-based proof-of-concept application.

### Context

Need to validate the technical feasibility of real-time posture monitoring using computer vision before committing to a full product development cycle. MediaPipe provides pre-trained models that can run efficiently in web browsers.

### Rationale

- MediaPipe offers production-ready pose detection models
- Web-based implementation provides broad accessibility
- Real-time processing capability is essential for user feedback
- POC approach allows rapid validation without heavy infrastructure investment
- Face + pose combination provides more comprehensive posture analysis than pose alone

## 2025-08-03: Web-First Platform Strategy

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Platform
**Stakeholders:** Developer, Product Owner

### Decision

Implement the POC as a web application using browser APIs rather than native mobile or desktop applications.

### Context

Multiple platform options available for computer vision applications, including native mobile apps, desktop applications, and web browsers.

### Rationale

- Fastest development and iteration cycle for POC validation
- No app store approvals or installation barriers
- Cross-platform compatibility with single codebase
- Direct access to camera via WebRTC without additional permissions
- Easier sharing and demonstration of POC results
