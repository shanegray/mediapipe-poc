> Spec: Cost-Effective Posture Detection Model Evaluation
> Created: 2025-08-07
> Status: In Progress

## Overview

Evaluate existing pre-trained pose detection models to find the most cost-effective solution for accurate posture analysis. This POC aims to answer: "What is the cheapest way to analyze a user's posture while they sit at their desk?" Given MediaPipe's browser limitations, we will evaluate alternative models including server-side deployments, interval-based capture, and other browser-compatible solutions.

## User Stories

### Cost-Effective Posture Detection

As a product owner, I want to identify the most cost-effective way to analyze user posture, so that we can provide affordable posture monitoring without expensive infrastructure.

The current MediaPipe browser implementation has proven insufficient for accurate posture detection. We need to evaluate alternative models and deployment strategies, comparing accuracy against total cost of ownership including infrastructure, API calls, and development complexity.

### Model Evaluation Framework

As a developer, I want comprehensive evaluation of existing pose detection models, so that I can make an informed decision on which solution provides the best accuracy-to-cost ratio.

This evaluation will test pre-trained models from Google (MoveNet, BlazePose variants), open-source solutions (MMPose, OpenPose), and compare real-time streaming versus interval-based capture approaches to find the optimal balance of accuracy, cost, and user experience.

## Spec Scope

1. **Model Evaluation Matrix** - Test and compare existing pre-trained models for accuracy and cost
2. **Google Models Assessment** - MediaPipe server-side, MoveNet, BlazePose variants, Cloud Vision API
3. **Advanced Models Research** - MMPose, OpenPose, ViTPose with infrastructure requirements
4. **Deployment Strategy Comparison** - Real-time streaming vs interval-based capture analysis
5. **Cost Analysis** - Monthly/yearly cost projections for each solution at scale
6. **Browser Compatibility Testing** - Evaluate browser-native solutions (TensorFlow.js, ONNX Runtime Web)

## Out of Scope

- Training new ML models
- Building custom pose detection algorithms
- Mobile-specific implementations
- Hardware solutions (depth cameras, specialized sensors)
- Clinical-grade accuracy requirements
- User authentication and data persistence

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Model Evaluation Report** - Comprehensive comparison of all tested models with accuracy metrics
2. **Cost Analysis Document** - Detailed breakdown of infrastructure and operational costs per solution
3. **Working Prototypes** - Top 3 most promising approaches implemented and tested
4. **Recommendation Report** - Clear winner for "cheapest effective solution" with justification
5. **Decision Matrix** - Stakeholder-friendly comparison table of all options
