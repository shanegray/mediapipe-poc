## Overview

Research and implement an improved posture detection algorithm that accurately identifies rounded shoulders, forward head posture, and general bad posture from multiple camera angles. This enhancement will replace the current simplistic algorithm with a comprehensive, research-based approach prioritizing accuracy over performance.

## User Stories

### Accurate Posture Detection

As a user monitoring my posture, I want the system to accurately detect when my shoulders are rounded or when I have poor posture, so that I receive meaningful feedback to improve my ergonomic health.

The current system uses basic landmark distance measurements that fail to detect common posture problems like rounded shoulders (shoulder protraction), forward head posture, and spinal misalignment. Users need reliable detection that matches what a physiotherapist would identify as poor posture, with the ability to work from both front-facing and side-view camera angles.

### Research-Based Analysis

As a developer, I want comprehensive research documentation on posture detection methods, so that I can implement the most effective algorithms based on ergonomic studies and existing solutions.

This research will explore academic findings, existing posture analysis applications, and practical implementation approaches to determine the best methods for detecting various posture issues using computer vision and pose estimation technologies.

## Spec Scope
