# Spec Summary (Lite)

Evaluate existing pre-trained pose detection models to find the most cost-effective solution for posture analysis. Test Google models (MoveNet, BlazePose, Cloud Vision), advanced models (MMPose, OpenPose, ViTPose), and compare real-time vs interval-based capture approaches. Deliver comprehensive cost analysis, accuracy metrics, and working prototypes to answer: "What is the cheapest way to analyze a user's posture while they sit at their desk?"
