# Phase 1 Improvements Implemented

## Overview
Based on the research plan, I've implemented the immediate Phase 1 improvements to the posture detection system.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Weighted Confidence Scoring
- Added reliability weights for each posture check based on MediaPipe's accuracy
- Weights range from 0.3 (unreliable shoulder landmarks) to 0.8 (reliable nose position)
- System now uses weighted confidence for status determination
- Thresholds: ≥75% weighted confidence = "good", ≥55% = "warning", <55% = "bad"

### 2. Personal Baseline Calibration
- Users can now calibrate their "good posture" baseline
- 10-second calibration period collects ~150 samples
- Metrics are adjusted relative to personal baseline
- Compensates for anatomical variance between users

### 3. Enhanced UI Features
- **Calibration button**: Start 10-second calibration period
- **Clear baseline button**: Remove stored baseline
- **Visual feedback**: Shows calibration progress and status
- **Weighted confidence display**: Shows both simple and weighted confidence scores

## How to Use

### Calibration Process
1. Sit in your best posture position
2. Click "Calibrate Good Posture" button
3. Maintain good posture for 10 seconds
4. System will store your baseline measurements
5. All future readings will be adjusted relative to your baseline

### Benefits
- **Reduced false positives**: Personal baseline eliminates anatomical variance issues
- **Better accuracy**: Weighted confidence gives more importance to reliable measurements
- **User control**: Can recalibrate anytime posture habits improve

## Technical Implementation

### PostureAnalyzer Changes
```typescript
// Reliability weights
private readonly WEIGHTS = {
    shoulderAlignment: 0.3,  // Low - unreliable
    headPosition: 0.8,       // High - reliable
    neckAngle: 0.5,         // Medium
    // ... etc
}

// Calibration methods
startCalibration(): void
stopCalibration(): UserBaseline | null
clearBaseline(): void
```

### Metrics Adjustment
When a baseline exists, metrics are adjusted:
```typescript
adjustedCVA = currentCVA - baselineCVA
```

This means a user with naturally forward head posture won't be constantly warned if that's their normal, comfortable position.

## Next Steps (Phase 2-3)

As outlined in the research plan:
1. **Data Collection**: Capture diverse posture samples with physiotherapist annotation
2. **ML Model Training**: Train Random Forest/XGBoost on collected data
3. **API Development**: Deploy model as serverless function
4. **Integration**: Replace heuristic checks with ML predictions

## Known Limitations

Despite improvements, the system still has fundamental limitations:
- MediaPipe shoulder landmarks remain unreliable in side view
- Cannot accurately detect subtle shoulder hunching
- Z-coordinates are noisy and inconsistent
- No landmarks for critical anatomical points (C7, scapula)

These require the ML approach outlined in Phase 2-3 of the research plan.
