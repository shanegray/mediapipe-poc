# Posture Detection Research Plan: Moving Beyond MediaPipe's Limitations

## Executive Summary

Our current MediaPipe-based posture detection system suffers from fundamental accuracy issues that cannot be resolved through threshold tuning alone. The core problems stem from:
1. **Inaccurate shoulder landmark placement** in side views (landmarks placed on visible edge rather than joint)
2. **Inability to detect shoulder hunching/elevation** from front view
3. **Poor neck angle detection** due to unreliable landmark positions
4. **No temporal consistency** leading to jittery, unreliable results

This document outlines a comprehensive research plan to achieve clinical-grade posture detection accuracy.

## Part 1: Current System Failure Analysis

### 1.1 MediaPipe Landmark Limitations

**Observed Issues:**
- Shoulder landmarks (11, 12) are placed on the visible shoulder outline, not the anatomical joint
- In side view, shoulders appear ~145% wider than elbows (physically impossible)
- Ear landmarks (7, 8) drift significantly based on head rotation
- Z-coordinates are noisy and unreliable for detecting forward/backward movement
- No landmarks for critical anatomical points (C7 vertebra, scapula, trapezius insertion points)

**Root Cause:**
MediaPipe Pose was trained for general pose estimation, not clinical posture assessment. It prioritizes:
- Fast inference (< 30ms)
- Robustness across activities (sports, dance, etc.)
- 2D accuracy over 3D precision

### 1.2 Test Data Analysis

From our captured test data:
- **Good posture (side)**: Detected as "Warning" with 62.5% confidence
- **Awful posture (side)**: Detected as "Warning" with 75% confidence (higher than good!)
- **Neck angle calculations**: Consistently showing 15-27° regardless of actual posture
- **Elbow-shoulder ratio**: > 100% in most cases, indicating landmark misplacement

### 1.3 Algorithmic Limitations

Current issues with our heuristic approach:
1. **No personalization**: Same thresholds for all body types
2. **No temporal modeling**: Each frame analyzed independently
3. **Binary thresholds**: No gradient between good/bad posture
4. **Limited features**: Only using basic geometric relationships
5. **No confidence weighting**: All checks weighted equally

## Part 2: State-of-the-Art Research

### 2.1 Academic Approaches

**Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) for Posture**
- JMIR 2024 study: 78% balanced accuracy using VideoPose3D + GCN
- Requires: 3D pose estimation, temporal windows, labeled training data
- Advantage: Learns complex spatial relationships between joints
- Limitation: Needs significant training data (10k+ frames)

**Clinical Photogrammetry Standards**
- Craniovertebral Angle (CVA): Gold standard for forward head posture
- Requires: Precise C7 vertebra location (not available in MediaPipe)
- Clinical threshold: CVA < 48° indicates forward head posture
- Sagittal shoulder angle: Measures shoulder protraction

**Temporal Modeling**
- LSTM/Temporal CNN: Detect sustained poor posture vs. momentary movements
- Sliding window approach: 1-3 second windows for stability
- Reduces false positives from reaching, stretching, temporary movements

## Conclusion

MediaPipe alone cannot provide clinical-grade posture detection. The path forward requires:

2. **Phase 2 (if needed):** Test advanced models in order: Hugging Face, MMPose, OpenPose, ViTPose
3. **Long-term:** Deploy the most effective solution based on accuracy/cost trade-offs

The final approach will be determined by Phase 1 results. If MediaPipe improvements succeed, we can maintain a browser-based, privacy-preserving architecture. If not, we'll systematically evaluate more advanced models.

**Next Step:** Begin Phase 1 - investigate PostureScreen and implement enhanced angle calculations.
